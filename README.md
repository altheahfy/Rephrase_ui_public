# RephraseUI  
RephraseUI is a grammar-aware training interface built on structured sentence decomposition.  
This repository contains the **UI implementation only**.  
  
---  
  
## What this is  
- A fully functional, real-world UI for sentence-level grammatical analysis, developed prior to the introduction of K-MAD.    
- Built before the introduction of K-MAD  
- Actively used as a frontend for structured language training  
  
The UI decomposes sentences into explicit grammatical slots (S / V / O / C / M, etc.)    
and supports interactive experimentation through a browser interface.

## What this is not  
- Not a conceptual demo  
- Not a toy project  
- Not governed by AI_Controller  
  
This codebase represents the **pre–K-MAD generation** of the system.  
 
---  
  
## Relationship to Other Projects  
- **The Automated Sentence Structuring System**    
  Uses a more advanced, governance-aware backend architecture.  
  
- **AI_Controller (K-MAD)**    
  Introduces decision-level governance for AI-driven development, which was not present when RephraseUI was originally built.  
  
RephraseUI exists as a concrete reference point for understanding why K-MAD became necessary.

## Status  
The UI is functional and publicly accessible.    
The code is published as-is for transparency and reference.  
  
## Legal Note  
Certain UI concepts and interaction patterns related to this system are covered by granted patents or pending applications.
